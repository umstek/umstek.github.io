I started programming as a hobby, by accident (kinda) when I was around 14 years or so. Me and friends had fun programming, back in the day. Initially it was just creating either batch scripts or desktop applications with Visual Basic 6 and then VB.NET without even having access to internet or even documentation most of the time. And we were good at problem solving. However, I couldn't continue that hobby for long, because of (traditional) education, exams etc.  

Before attending college, I learned a bit of Java and could write C# too. While I was in the college I learned the usual stuff that's bundled with my Computer Science and Engineering degree, like OOP, Networking, DBMS, Algorithms etc., and also several new languages, mainstream frameworks and tools, thanks to my interest in everything related to computers and because of the projects had to do. php/symfony, TypeScript, React, NodeJS, MySQL, python, Git, Blockchain concept, to name a few. I liked everything but got bored pretty easily.  

I have loved every subject in some stage of my life. But the ones I still love are... I don't know. Probably linguistics? And that includes programming languages (believe me, they are also human languages), music, and slightly mathematics (I'm terrible at it). I believe everything is a language at some level. I like cryptography too. My latest interest, however, is philosophy.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer, in a bankrupt 3rd world country in Asia, and not planning to leave it. My usual tech stack is TypeScript React, NodeJS, and MongoDB, although I'm fine with anything, as long as it is not outdated and depressing. I like functional (+reactive) programming,my favorite language is Rust and I'm still learning it.
