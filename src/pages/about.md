Hi, I’m Wickramaranga.

I started programming by accident when I was still in school. Back then, I had fun coding with my friends, mostly writing batch scripts and desktop applications in VB6 and VB.NET—often without internet access or proper documentation. We got by with sheer curiosity and problem-solving. Eventually, school and exams forced me to set programming aside for a while.

Before university, I picked up some Java and C#. Later, during my Computer Science and Engineering degree, I studied software engineering, networking, DBMS, algorithms, and AI/ML. In parallel, I taught myself a range of languages and tools: PHP/Symfony, MySQL, JavaScript, Python, Git, and early blockchain fundamentals, among others.

I tend to be interested in everything, though I get bored easily. At one point or another, I’ve loved almost every subject. The ones that have stayed with me—probably linguistics (including programming languages), music, and a bit of mathematics (though I’m terrible at it). I see all of them as forms of language. I also enjoy cryptography, and lately, I’ve been diving into philosophy.

Today, I work as a Software Engineer (Tech Lead, to be precise), living in a third world country that’s seen its share of challenges. My usual tech stack is TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, but I’m comfortable with anything modern and practical. I’m especially interested in functional (reactive) programming, software architecture, and the evolving landscape of applied AI and machine learning.
